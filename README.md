# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease-XGBoost

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. 
It is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremors, stiffness,
slowness of movement, and balance problems.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used for supervised learning problems,
such as classification and regression. It is based on the gradient boosting framework and uses a series of decision trees to make predictions.

In the context of Parkinson's disease prediction, XGBoost can be used to analyze data from various sources, such as medical records, imaging studies,
and genetic testing. The algorithm can identify patterns and relationships in the data that may be useful for predicting the risk of developing Parkinson's disease
or for diagnosing the disease at an early stage.

Some of the factors that can have an effect on Parkinson's disease prediction using XGBoost include:

1. Data quality: The accuracy and completeness of the data used for training and testing the XGBoost model can have a significant
   impact on the performance of the algorithm.

2. Feature selection: Choosing the most relevant features or variables to include in the model can improve its accuracy and reduce
   the risk of overfitting.

3. Model parameters: Tuning the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model, such as the learning rate and the number of trees, can affect
   its performance.

4. Sample size: The size of the dataset used for training and testing the model can affect its accuracy and generalizability.

Overall, XGBoost has shown promise in predicting Parkinson's disease risk and improving diagnostic accuracy, but further research is needed to
fully evaluate its potential in clinical practice.
